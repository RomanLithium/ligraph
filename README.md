# ligraph

The LIGRAPH module is a tool that can be used as a module in equation-solving graph plotters. It provides user with four useful functions: 2D and 3D graph generators and simple plotters for them. The advantage of LIGRAPH is its ability to solve implicit equations that contain both cartesian and polar/spherical coordinates simultaneously. Check example files for examples.
